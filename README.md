# Ross ðŸš²

**AI-powered client acquisition for personal injury lawyers**

## Overview

Ross is a fullstack AI agent that transforms how personal injury law firms identify and engage potential clients. The system ingests public police reports, intelligently extracts actionable leads, and orchestrates multi-channel outreach campaigns through email, direct mail, and AI-powered phone calls.

Rather than manually reviewing hundreds of incident reports, lawyers can use natural language to filter prospects by criteria like location, injury severity, insurance coverage, and incident type. Once qualified leads are identified, Ross automates the entire outreach workflowâ€”from drafting personalized communications to scheduling consultations via AI voice agents.

## Fullstack Agent

Ross exemplifies fullstack agent integration through three core capabilities:

**Structured Reasoning**: LlamaIndex orchestrates complex document processing pipelines, transforming unstructured police reports into queryable, actionable intelligence. The agent maintains context across multiple data sources and applies domain-specific legal heuristics to surface high-value leads.

**Real-World Actions**: Through Composio and MCP integrations, Ross executes tangible business operationsâ€”sending emails via Resend, initiating direct mail through PostGrid/Lob APIs, conducting phone outreach with Vapi voice agents, and synchronizing appointment data to Google Sheets and Cal.com.

**Dynamic Frontend**: CopilotKit and AG-UI power an adaptive interface that responds to natural language queries. The UI dynamically generates filtered views, data visualizations, and action buttons based on user intent, eliminating the need for complex form-based interfaces.

## Core Features

- **Automated Report Processing**: Ingests police reports and extracts structured data including parties involved, incident details, injury descriptions, insurance information, and contact details
- **Intelligent Lead Summarization**: Generates concise, lawyer-focused summaries highlighting case viability factors
- **Natural Language Filtering**: Enables conversational queries like "show me rear-end collisions in downtown with documented injuries and commercial insurance"
- **Multi-Channel Outreach Orchestration**: Executes personalized campaigns across email, physical mail, and voice channels
- **AI Voice Agent**: Conducts initial prospect calls, explains services, and books consultations directly into the lawyer's calendar
- **Automated CRM Updates**: Logs all interactions and outcomes to Google Sheets for tracking and compliance
