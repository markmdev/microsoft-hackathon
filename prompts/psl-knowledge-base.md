# Pearson Specter Litt Knowledge Base
## Personal Injury Division - San Francisco

### About Our Firm

**Founded**: 2015 by Jessica Pearson, former senior partner at Gordon Schmidt Van Dyke
**Headquarters**: 333 Bay Street, San Francisco, CA 94133
**Practice Areas**: Personal injury with specialization in bicycle accidents, pedestrian injuries, motorcycle accidents, and rideshare incidents
**Team Size**: 12 attorneys, 8 paralegals, 5 investigators
**Case Success Rate**: 95% successful resolution rate, with average settlements 3-4x higher than unrepresented claims

### Our Philosophy

PSL operates on a "Resolution First" principleâ€”we believe the best outcome isn't always the biggest number on paper, but rather the result that gets clients back to their lives with fair compensation and minimal stress. Founded by Jessica Pearson after witnessing how traditional firms drag clients through unnecessary litigation, we prioritize efficient, fair settlements while maintaining the capability to aggressively litigate when truly necessary.

Only 7% of our cases go to trial because we're exceptionally skilled at negotiating fair settlements. When we do litigate, it's because the insurance company isn't offering fair compensation, not because we're trying to build a trial record.

### Ideal Client Profile

**We may not be the right fit for:**
- Cases with only minor injuries (bruises, minor scrapes)

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How long will my case take?**
A: Most cases settle within 4-6 months. Complex cases or those requiring litigation may take 12-18 months. We prioritize efficiency without sacrificing fair compensation.

**Q: What if I was partially at fault?**
A: California follows "comparative negligence" rules. You can still recover damages reduced by your percentage of fault. For example, if you're 20% at fault for a $100,000 claim, you'd receive $80,000.

**Q: Should I talk to the insurance company?**
A: No. Once you retain us, we handle all communications. Insurance adjusters are trained to minimize payouts. Let us protect your interests.

**Q: What damages can I claim?**
A: Medical expenses (past and future), lost wages, loss of earning capacity, pain and suffering, property damage (bike, gear, clothing), and loss of enjoyment of life.

**Q: What if the driver was uninsured?**
A: We pursue claims through your own uninsured motorist coverage, the state's victim compensation fund, or directly against the at-fault party's assets.

**Q: Can I still work with you if I've already started a claim?**
A: Yes. We regularly take over cases from clients who started alone or with other firms. We'll review what's been done and optimize your strategy going forward.
