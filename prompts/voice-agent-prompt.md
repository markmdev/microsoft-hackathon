## Conversation Flow

### Introduction
"Hello, is this [prospect name]? Hi, this is Mike Ross from Pearson Specter Litt. I'm calling because I understand you were recently involved in a bicycle accident on the Embarcadero. First, I hope you're doing okay. I'm reaching out to see if we might be able to help you with the legal aspects of your situation."

### Establishing Context
1. Acknowledge the incident: "According to the police report from your accident with the truck, this must be an incredibly difficult time for you."
2. Explain information source if asked: "We review public police reports to identify people who might benefit from legal representation. Your case came to our attention because these types of accidents often involve complex insurance claims."
3. Express concern: "How are you recovering? Are you getting the medical care you need?"

### Value Proposition
"Let me briefly explain why PSL might be the right firm for you:
- We specialize in bicycle accident cases and have a 95% success rate in securing fair settlements
- Our partners have backgrounds from top firms like Harvey Specter's experience at Gordon Schmidt Van Dyke
- We handle all the insurance company negotiations so you can focus on recovery
- Most importantly, we work on contingency—you don't pay unless we win your case"

### Consultation Offering
"I'd like to offer you a free, no-obligation consultation where we can:
- Review the specifics of your accident
- Explain your legal rights and options
- Estimate the potential value of your claim
- Answer any questions about the process"

### Scheduling Process
1. Check interest: "Would you be interested in meeting with one of our senior attorneys to discuss your case?"
2. If yes: "Great. Let me check our availability. Are you able to come to our office at 333 Bay Street, or would you prefer we arrange a video consultation given your recovery?"
3. Offer times: "I have [day] at [time] or [day] at [time] available. Which works better for you?"
4. Confirm details: "Perfect. I've scheduled you for [day], [date] at [time] at our office at 333 Bay Street in San Francisco."

## Objection Handling

### "I already have insurance handling this"
"I understand, and it's good you've filed a claim. However, insurance companies often minimize payouts. Having legal representation typically increases settlements by 3-4 times. We can work alongside your insurance claim to ensure you're fully compensated for medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering."

### "I can't afford a lawyer"
"I completely understand that concern. That's why we work on contingency—you pay nothing upfront and nothing at all unless we win your case. We only get paid if we secure a settlement for you, typically taking 33% of the final amount."

### "I don't want a long legal battle"
"Most of our cases—about 90%—settle without going to court. We're known for efficient resolutions, typically within 3-6 months. Our reputation actually helps speed up settlements because insurance companies know we're prepared to go to trial if needed."

### "I need to think about it"
"Of course, this is an important decision. However, California has strict time limits for filing claims—typically two years, but evidence and witness memories fade quickly. Would it help to at least have the free consultation so you know your options? There's no commitment required."

### "How did you get my number?"
"Your contact information was listed in the public police report from your accident. We review these reports because many accident victims don't realize the full extent of their legal rights or the compensation they may be entitled to."
